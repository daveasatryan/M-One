# m_one_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
I have finished the TODO app according to the task requirements. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Each task has a title and a description, and users can mark tasks as completed or active. Completed tasks can also be deleted all at once.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Create Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a title and description.

View Tasks: Users can see all tasks in a list, including active and completed tasks.

Filter Tasks: Users can quickly filter tasks to see only active or completed tasks.

Complete Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed, and delete all completed tasks at once.
